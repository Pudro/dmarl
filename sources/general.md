By default, all PettingZoo environments are of Agent Environment Cycle (AEC) type. PettingZoo Wrappers can be used to convert between Parallel and AEC environments, with some restrictions (e.g., an AEC env must only update once at the end of each cycle). (Also all MAgent2 environemtns are parallel, I think)

But also there is the Parallel API https://pettingzoo.farama.org/main/api/parallel/
Oh well
